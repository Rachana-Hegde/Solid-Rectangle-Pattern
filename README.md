# 🟦 Solid Rectangle Pattern in Python

This is a beginner-friendly Python program that prints a **solid rectangle pattern** using `*` symbols based on user input. It demonstrates the use of loops and basic input handling.

## 📌 Description

The user provides the number of **rows (`a`)** and **columns (`b`)**, and the program prints a solid rectangle of stars (`*`) with that dimension.

### 🧾 Sample Output

**Input:**

```
Enter number of rows: 4  
Enter number of columns: 5
```

**Output:**

```
* * * * *  
* * * * *  
* * * * *  
* * * * *  
```

## 🧠 Logic

* Read `a` (rows) and `b` (columns) from user input.
* Use a `while` loop to repeat printing `*` `b` times per line.
* Repeat the process `a` times for the rows.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `solid_rectangle.py`.
2. Run it using Python:
   ```bash
python solid_rectangle.py
```
3. Enter the number of rows and columns as prompted.

## 🎯 Use Case

* Great exercise for beginners learning **loops**, **input handling**, and **basic pattern printing**.
* Can be extended to create other shapes like hollow rectangles, pyramids, etc.
